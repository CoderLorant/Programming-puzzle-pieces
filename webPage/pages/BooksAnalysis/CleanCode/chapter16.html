<h3>16. Refactoring SerialDate</h3>
[I had chosen to skip this chapter for now. It contains a set of refactorization of the Java library org.jfree.date. For this kind of practical stuff I will think on a different approach, like youtube tutorials or a codebase and reference them here. Until that if you are interested, consider finding this chapter for yourself in the book.]
