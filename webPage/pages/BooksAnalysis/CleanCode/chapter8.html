<h3>8. Boundaries</h3>
<b>Using Third-Party Code</b><br/>
"There is a natural tension between the provider of an interface and the user of an interface. Providers of third-party packages and frameworks strive for broad applicability so they can work in many environments and appeal to a wide audience. Users, on the other hand, want an interface that is focused on their particular needs. This tension can cause problems at the boundaries of our systems."
<br/><br/>
"If you use a boundary interface like Map, keep it inside the class, or close family of classes, where it is used. Avoid returning it from, or accepting it as an argument to, public APIs."
<br/><br/>
<b>Exploring and Learning Boundaries</b><br/>
"Learn the third-party code is hard. Integrating the third-party code is hard too. Doing both at the same time is doubly hard. What if we took a different approach? Instead of experimenting and trying out the new stuff in our production code, we could write some tests to explore our understanding of the third-party code. Jim Newkirk calls such test learning tests."
<br/><br/>
[There is an example in the book for this method applied on the log4j(Java) console logger]
<br/><br/>
<b>Learning Tests Are Better Than Free</b><br/>
"Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investment. When there are new releases of the third-party package, we run the learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences."
<br/><br/>
"If the third-party package changes in some way incompatible with our tests, we will find out right away."
<br/><br/>
<b>Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist</b><br/>
"There is another kind of boundary, one that separates known from the unknown. There are often places in the code where our knowledge seems to drop off the edge. Sometimes what is on the other side of the boundary is unknowable (at least right now). Sometimes we choose to look no farther than the boundary."
<br/><br/>
[This chapter advises the using of the Adapter method by creating an interface and implement a fake class just to keep work going on until the real class what will do the work is incomplete]
<br/><br/>
"One good thing about writing the interface we wish we had is that it's under our control. This helps keep client code more readable and focused on what it is trying to accomplish."
<br/><br/>
<b>Clean Boundaries</b><br/>
"Code at the boundaries needs clear separation and tests that define expectations. We should avoid letting too much of our code know about the third-party particulars. It's better to depend on something you control than on something you don't control, lest it end up controlling you."
<br/><br/>
"We may wrap them as we did with Map, or we may use an ADAPTER to convert from our perfect interface to the provided interface. Either way our code speaks to us better, promotes internally consistent usage across the boundary, and has fewer maintenance point when the third-party code changes."
