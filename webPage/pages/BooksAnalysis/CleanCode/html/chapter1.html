"<i>Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Neither architecture nor clean code insist on perfection, only honesty and doing the best we can.
To err is human; to forgive, divine.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Learning to write clean code is hard work. 
It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must swear over it. 
You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. 
They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that's their job. 
It's your job to defend the code with equal passion.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>The only way to make the deadline - the only way to go fast - is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>The bad news is that writing clean code is a lot like painting a picture. 
Most of us know when a picture is painted well or badly. 
But being able to recognize good art from bad does not mean that we know how to paint. 
So too being able to recognize clean code from dirty does not mean that we know how to write clean code!</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Bad code tempts the mess to grow!</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Clean code is focused. Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely 
undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Like a good novel, clean code should clearly expose the tensions in the problem to be solved. 
It should build those tensions to a climax and then give the reader that "Aha! Of course!" as the issues and tensions are 
resolved in the revelation of an obvious solution.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Code, without tests, is not clean. No matter how elegant it is, no matter how readable and accessible, 
if it hath not tests, it be unclean.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. 
They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple abstractions. That's what makes clean code for me.</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple!</i>"
<br/><br/>
"<i>Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1. 
We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.</i>"
