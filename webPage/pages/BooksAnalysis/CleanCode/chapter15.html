<h3>15. JUnit Internals</h3>
[I had chosen to skip this chapter for now. It contains a step-by-step refactorization on a piece of code found in the Java JUnit framework. I am thinking on a different approach to present examples. Maybe youtube tutorials and/or a codebase which I will reference in this page when will have the plan and "infrastructure" for this. Until that consider finding this chapter by yourself in the book if interested.]
