This directory with this filename is one clue for finding the root of this project.

Other clues are:

- local git repo represented by the .git directory
- parent directory containing specific hardcoded files and directories
- number of parent directories in relative paths requested from the github API (devel branch)
- name of parent directories in relative paths requested from the github API (devel branch)

The most common path is accepted for the project root with the following restrictions: 
 - all other paths are less common (no choosing between 50% Vs 50% or 30% Vs 30%)
 - at least 2 approaches results the same exact path
