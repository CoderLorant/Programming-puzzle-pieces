> This is an on-going personal project without the guarantee to contain everything it should tending to collect the general 'should-know' puzzle pieces in programming but without diving into different languages, frameworks, libraries and technologies (for now).

## Disclaimer
:world_map: This is a simplified visual representation. The scope is to remain simple and to cover a large variety of different terms used in programming in the same time. Explaining the different concepts and providing examples for them is outside of the scope for now. My advice is to do your own research by yourself if you are interested in a specific topic and use this project as a collection of the "existing things" for your studies.

:recycle: If you want you can use freely the entire image and / or the attached visio files or just a portion of it and modify it without any limitation and without mentioning me or the github page (it is your decision).

:pushpin: If you are interested in other similar projects, please check [this web developer roadmap on github](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).

## Backlog

Just a set of ideas I conider to extend or invent a main topic for them in the future.

# Personal recommendation for a fresh (re)start:

:blue_book: :sparkling_heart: But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone

The book provides a general and simplified look about how a computer works, which are the main components that makes it easily programmable, how a program really looks and gets executed on a computer. All the examples and illustrations are well explained so the entire book can be easily understood. It can give you the taste about the different aspects any programming language deals with in different ways.

![topics/Online-resources](topics/onlineResources.png "online resources")

Always having your resources where you learn and practice from greatly helps you mastering any topic by yourself without depending on the education system, mentor, etc. It is a choice to develop yourself in your rihtm by determining your invested time and energy.

Programming principles are simple ideas proposed as advices in order to help to keep your code clear and maintainable. It is also a common programming mentality, a way of thinking when you have to deal with a more complex project.

A design pattern is "a generalized solution to a commonly occuring problem". Three important aspects needs to be taken into consideration: 
1. **Problem:** _has aspect of design regarding to a specific optimization or to a non-functional requirement (also known as QoS - quality of System)_
2. **Solution:** _the pattern itself having a specific structure and roles_
3. **Consequances:** _since a pattern optimizes some aspects over others, it is importand to understand the negative and positive aspects as well._

Also a design pattern is meant to follow the SOLID principles and by this it can offer a comfortable solution.

### How can I contribute?
If you observe any missing important elements which are part of programming generally speaking (not specific to a language, framework or library) or find any kind of inacurracy or mistake please feel free to open a new issue and try to motivate your reason. Every observation and suggestion is welcomed and I will try to react to all of them. You actively improve the quality of the project by this and also offer a cleaner quality of information for the other visitors. Thank you for helping :+1:
