> I can teach you the physics of riding a bicycle. Indeed, the classical mathematics is relatively straightforward. Gravity, friction, angular momentum, center of mass, and so forth, can be demonstrated with less than a page full of equations. Given those formulae I could provide you that bicycle riding is practical and give you all the knowldge you needed to make it work. And you'd still fall down the first time you climbed on that bike. Coding is no different.

## Disclaimer
:world_map: This project mainly contains simplified visual representations. The scope is to remain simple and to cover a large variety of different terms used in programming in the same time. Explaining the different concepts and providing examples for them is outside of the scope for now. My advice is to do your own research by yourself if you are interested in a specific topic and use this project as a collection of the "existing things" for your studies.

:recycle: You can use or reuse any image and / or the attached visio files entirely or just a portion of it and modify it without any limitation. Mentioning this github page is not mandatory but it is always appreciated.

## Backlog

This is a portion from the very first single image file. My initial plan trying to include everything in a single image turned out not to be efficient to follow, read and extend. Now I am just uing as a backlog and delete from it every time I reuse an element from it.

# Personal recommendation for a fresh (re)start:

:blue_book: :sparkling_heart: But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone

The book provides a general and simplified look about how a computer works, which are the main components that makes it easily programmable, how a program really looks and gets executed on a computer. All the examples and illustrations are well explained so the entire book can be easily understood. It can give you the taste about the different aspects any programming language deals with in different ways.

Always having your resources where you learn and practice from greatly helps you mastering any topic by yourself without depending on the education system, mentor, etc. It is a choice to develop yourself in your rihtm by determining your invested time and energy.

Programming principles are simple ideas proposed as advices in order to help to keep your code clear and maintainable. It is also a common programming mentality, a way of thinking when you have to deal with a complex project.

A design pattern is "a generalized solution to a commonly occuring problem". Three important aspects needs to be taken into consideration: 
1. **Problem:** _has aspect of design regarding to a specific optimization or to a non-functional requirement (also known as QoS - quality of System)_
2. **Solution:** _the pattern itself having a specific structure and roles_
3. **Consequances:** _since a pattern optimizes some aspects over others, it is importand to understand the negative and positive aspects as well._

Also a design pattern is meant to follow the SOLID principles and by this it can offer a comfortable solution.
