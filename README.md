# Personal roadmap

It is a personal collection without the intent to contain everything or to recruit the greatest programers with that. If you are interested in professional roadmaps, please check [this github page](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). I plan to update it frequently so updates and design fixes will be coming if you look back. If you like, use it how you want.

### Why do I do this?
0. 90% of the knowledge I have I learned from the internet. 9% are books downloaded and ordered from internet and 1% is the local 
education system. Nowadays I learn day by day many hours from awesome sites. So much that I ignore my university for this. So internet, 
if you find this interesting, use this picture and information how you want.
1. It is quite frustrating that almost every time I try to learn or understand something I always have to find out that there is a basic 
notion, principle, methodology or a should know thing that I does not know. Thank you my computer science university :kissing_heart:. So I 
took a decision to learn by myself and figure out basic things as a starting point to see the building blocks. This image can serve as a 
remainder for the building blocks.
2. In general thematic developer communities sometimes it can be hard to understand everyone at a concept level at least. So every time I 
meet a notion, principle, methodology, pattern, book, anything important I write it down, learn it later to acknowledge a general 
understanding and see if I can include in the image.
3. I asked myself how a general "should-know" roadmap would look like for the past version of me so this seems to be a funny and an 
interesting experiment.
4. There is definetely a lot of confusing knowledge for an enthusiastic beginner to manage all those useful information. If I will make for 
them sometime in the future tutorial videos (in hungarian and/or romanian language) then I will definetely take a look at the "building 
blocks".
